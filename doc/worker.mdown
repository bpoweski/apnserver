# Racoon Worker

Workers are very simple devices. They sit at the front-end and pop items off the beanstalk cluster.
They create the notifications, and feed them out to the connector.

## Parts

* Popper
	This piece pops items off of the beanstalk cluster. It creates notifications, and passes them
	over the firehose.
* Firehose
	This is a push socket where we send the results from the popper. These are the results preprepared
	to be written over the socket.
